## Quick Example

```typescript
import { string, number, sequence, many, map } from "parserator";

// Parse a simple arithmetic expression
const digit = number();
const operator = string("+").or(string("-"));
const expression = sequence(digit, many(sequence(operator, digit)));

const result = expression.parse("1+2-3+4");
console.log(result); // Success with parsed AST
```

## Installation

```bash
# Using npm
npm install parserator

# Using yarn
yarn add parserator

# Using pnpm
pnpm add parserator

# Using bun
bun add parserator
```

## Why Parserator?

### Simple Yet Powerful

Start with basic parsers and combine them to handle complex grammars. No need to learn a separate grammar syntax - it's just TypeScript.

### Battle-Tested Patterns

Based on proven parser combinator techniques used in functional programming languages, adapted for the TypeScript ecosystem.

### Excellent Error Recovery

Get helpful error messages that point to exactly where parsing failed, with context about what was expected.

### Zero Dependencies

Parserator has no runtime dependencies, keeping your bundle size small and your builds fast.
